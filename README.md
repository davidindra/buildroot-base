# Buildroot base Docker image

This repository is linked to [davidindracz/buildroot-base](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davidindracz/buildroot-base/general) Docker image, which is used for completely isolating buildroot environment utilizing Docker containers.

It is maintained by [myself](https://github.com/davidindra); I will try to keep it up-to-date with the latest buildroot versions. Pull requests are welcome!
